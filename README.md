## Background

Libraries like EPUB.JS provide a great methods of reading and parsing various EPubs.  However, the nature of the ePub format usually requires an iFrame since there are several underlying HTML pages that can be associated with a particular book.  When creating an application that focuses on the content of a single book or document, it is better to move the format to a single document complimented with lazy loading for images.  The intent of the library is to be utilized in a webview in a mobile application.
